My project is a smart dustbin using iot.In which I am going to segregate dry waste, wet waste, metallic waste. In each section like the dry, wet, metallic ultrasonic sensor is fitted.It is going to check the level.and iam going to show it by distenc vs date in thingspeak. I want to write mathematcal equation in reserch paper i want mathematic equation

To write a research paper for your IoT-based smart dustbin project, you may need to include mathematical equations that describe the relationships or principles involved in your system. Here are some equations you can consider including in your paper, based on your project's objectives:

Ultrasonic Sensor Equation:

You can use the speed of sound equation to calculate the distance (level) using an ultrasonic sensor.

Speed of Sound Equation: 
 
=
 
 
v= 
ρ
T
​
 
​
 

Where:

 
v is the speed of sound.
 
T is the temperature.
 
ρ is the air density.
Distance Calculation Equation:

 
=
 
⋅
 
2
d= 
2
v⋅t
​
 
Where:
 
d is the distance (level) measured by the sensor.
 
t is the time taken for the ultrasonic wave to travel to the object and back to the sensor.
Segregation Level Calculation:

You can use a simple equation to calculate the segregation level for each type of waste:
 
=
 
 
max
S= 
V 
max
​
 
V
​
 
Where:
 
S is the segregation level for a particular type of waste.
 
V is the current volume of that type of waste in the dustbin.
 
max
V 
max
​
  is the maximum volume that the dustbin can hold for that type of waste.
Data Transmission Equation:

To transmit data to ThingSpeak, you can use the equation for data transmission, considering factors such as data rate, bandwidth, and transmission time.
 
=
 
 
R= 
W
B
​
 
Where:
 
R is the data rate.
 
B is the available bandwidth.
 
W is the transmission time.
Accumulated Data Over Time:

To calculate the data accumulated in ThingSpeak over time, you can use a simple integration equation:
 
(
 
)
=
∫
0
 
 
 
 
 
D(t)=∫ 
0
t
​
 Rdt
Where:
 
(
 
)
D(t) is the accumulated data at time 
 
t.
 
R is the data rate as calculated in the data transmission equation.
 
t is the time.
Data Visualization Equation:

If you want to show the data as a distance vs. date graph in ThingSpeak, you don't need a specific equation, but you can represent it as:
 
=
 
(
 
)
y=f(x)
Where:
 
y is the distance (level) measured by the ultrasonic sensor.
 
x is the date or time at which the measurement was taken.
Make sure to provide proper explanations and context for these equations in your research paper, including how they relate to your smart dustbin project and the IoT components. Additionally, consider using relevant units and variables in your equations.

Certainly, if you want to express these equations in terms of waste segregation management, you can adapt them as follows:

Ultrasonic Sensor Equation for Waste Level:

Use the speed of sound equation to calculate the waste level in your smart dustbin:
 
level
=
 
⋅
 
sound
2
W 
level
​
 = 
2
t⋅v 
sound
​
 
​
 
Where:
 
level
W 
level
​
  is the level of waste in the dustbin.
 
t is the time taken for the ultrasonic wave to travel to the waste and back.
 
sound
v 
sound
​
  is the speed of sound in the environment.
Waste Segregation Level Equation:

Calculate the segregation level for each type of waste as a fraction of the total waste level:
 
waste type
=
 
type
 
total
S 
waste type
​
 = 
W 
total
​
 
W 
type
​
 
​
 
Where:
 
waste type
S 
waste type
​
  is the segregation level for a specific waste type.
 
type
W 
type
​
  is the volume of a particular type of waste.
 
total
W 
total
​
  is the total volume of waste in the dustbin.
Data Transmission Equation for Waste Data:

Transmit waste segregation data to ThingSpeak:
 
data
=
 
 
data
R 
data
​
 = 
W 
data
​
 
B
​
 
Where:
 
data
R 
data
​
  is the data rate for waste segregation data.
 
B is the available bandwidth for data transmission.
 
data
W 
data
​
  is the time taken to transmit waste data.
Accumulated Data Over Time for Waste:

Calculate the cumulative waste segregation data sent to ThingSpeak over time:
 
waste
(
 
)
=
∫
0
 
 
data
 
 
 
D 
waste
​
 (t)=∫ 
0
t
​
 R 
data
​
 dt
Where:
 
waste
(
 
)
D 
waste
​
 (t) is the accumulated waste segregation data at time 
 
t.
Data Visualization for Waste Segregation:

Display the waste segregation data on ThingSpeak as a function of time:
 
type
=
 
(
 
)
W 
type
​
 =f(t)
Where:
 
type
W 
type
​
  represents the waste level for a specific type of waste.
 
t is the time or date at which the segregation data was recorded.
In your research paper, provide detailed explanations of how these equations are applied in your waste segregation management system. Be sure to discuss the relevance of each equation to the goals of your smart dustbin project and how they contribute to effective waste segregation.
